## Description
Welcome. In this process I have tried to create an app with basic funtionality similar to that of a well fleged Trading app allowing us to knid of create our own portfolio based on live market data. Working of the app could be understood by the video in the above link.

### Funtionalities
For each of the bellow points we have a page dedicated in the app.
1. Place and order of stock i.e. adding a stock to your portfolio.
    1. Here, we need to provide the ticker symbol of the stock we want to add to our portfolio. For US stocks, we can simply mention their tickers, but for Indian stocks, we should include a '.NS' extension. For example, if we want to add Tata Motors, we would write "TATAMOTORS.NS" in the provided field.
    2. After this step, you will receive the previous day's OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data and the current price.
    3. Additionally, you will receive a prediction indicating whether it's advisable to buy this stock or not.
    4. In addition to this, we have various indicator plots such as RSI, MACD, and 3EMA.


2. Plotting the trend of the stock for a time window selected by you.
   1. Here we need to enter the ticker and select time window . So after submiting we would get the chart displayed in the foeld.
4. Viewing all the transaction made by you till date.
5. Optimizing the portfolio based on the stocks you choose.
6. Finding the gains that you have earned on your portfolio.
7. Selling the stocks from your portfolio.
