## Description
Welcome. In this process I have tried to create an app with basic funtionality similar to that of a well fleged Trading app allowing us to knid of create our own portfolio based on live market data. Working of the app could be understood by the video in the above link.

### Funtionalities
For each of the bellow points we have a page dedicated in the app.
1. Place and order of stock i.e. adding a stock to your portfolio.
2. Plotting the trend of the stock for a time window selected by you.
3. Viewing all the transaction made by you till date.
4. Optimizing the portfolio based on the stocks you choose.
5. Finding the gains that you have earned on your portfolio.
6. Selling the stocks from your portfolio.
